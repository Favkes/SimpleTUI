SimpleTUI is a small package useful for developing Text User Interface applications on the whim.

It provides:
- A `Color` ANSII escape code class
- A `DisplayCore` class with minimal functionality of a terminal rendering engine
- A `Displayer` class, inheriting from `DisplayCore`, with more extensive capabilities (yet to come)
- Your dad (lost between the files)

## Development stage

This package is currently in early development!

It should definitely be used with precautions and thoughtfulness.


## Setup

To build and execute the example application -`Main.java`, run the `run_the_fucker.bat` script on Windows,
or it's counterpart - `run_the_fucker.sh` on Linux (yet to come).

## Docs

The docs will probably at some point arise, 
though the decade of designation is not quite clear yet.
